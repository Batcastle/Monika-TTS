# Monika-TTS
Text-To-Speech Submod for Monika After Story!


## NOTE
### Mimic
Mimic is too big to include the binaries for it in this GitHub repository. You can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic1).

Pre-built binaries are available for Windows, and building on Linux is relatively easy.

### Performance
Mimic, despite being comparatively light-weight, is actually very laggy. If you want better performance to get Monika's voice synced up with the on-screen text, I suggest using `espeak` on Linux. The downfall of this is Monika will sound more robotic.
